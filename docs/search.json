Using a structural equation model and directed acyclic graph, the plan formalizes the impact of intercurrent events such as treatment switching, disenrollment, and differential monitoring. An example analysis is implemented on HealthVerity claims data to estimate adherence–outcome relationships using longitudinal targeted maximum likelihood estimation (TMLE), adjusted for time-varying confounding and censoring. A simulation study then replicates key data-generating features—pharmacy fill patterns, lab engagement, and switching behavior—under varying degrees of adherence and confounding, to benchmark estimator performance and assess bias in standard Cox models versus TMLE under the causal roadmap framework\n\n\nCausal Roadmap case study of an acute kidney injury safety analysis\nhttps://bookdown.org/amertens/causal-roadmap-tutorial/"

    "text": "This workshop introduces the Causal Roadmap and Targeted Maximum Likelihood Estimation (TMLE) through a motivating example: a post-market evaluation of cardiovascular safety among patients treated with denosumab (Prolia) vs. zoledronic acid for osteoporosis. The goal is to show how causal inference frameworks help produce transparent, reproducible real-world evidence.\nIn 2023, Amgen conducted a large-scale retrospective cohort study across two US claims databases, comparing denosumab with zoledronic acid. After adjusting for confounding using inverse probability weighting, the study found no increased risk of myocardial infarction or stroke up to 36 months of follow-up【204†source】. Here, we will reconstruct a simplified version of this question using the causal roadmap and a TMLE implementation.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nGoal: Learn how to define, identify, and estimate a causal effect with TMLE, using machine learning for nuisance function estimation.\n\n\n Figure 1. The Causal Roadmap, adapted for pharmacoepidemiologic safety analysis."
