Each chapter builds on the previous ones, progressing from foundational concepts to advanced methods with worked R code examples throughout.\n\n## How to use this book\n\nThe chapters are organized into three parts plus appendices. Part I builds the conceptual foundations you need before running any estimator. Part II walks through each major estimation strategy with hands-on code. Part III covers advanced topics that extend these methods to realistic, complex settings. You can read the book front-to-back or jump to specific chapters as needed.\n\n---\n\n## Part I: Foundations\n\nThese chapters establish the conceptual framework for causal inference --- why standard regression is not enough, how the Causal Roadmap structures an analysis, and how we formally link causal questions to quantities we can estimate from data.\n\n| Chapter | Description |\n|---------|-------------|\n| [1.1 Regression vs. Causal Inference](01-01-regression-vs-causal.qmd) | Why regression coefficients are not causal effects, and what the counterfactual framework offers instead. |\n| [1.2 The Causal Roadmap](01-02-causal-roadmap.qmd) | The six-step Causal Roadmap for structuring any causal analysis: from question to interpretation. |\n| [1.3 Identification and Estimands](01-03-identification-estimands.qmd) | Formal identification assumptions (consistency, exchangeability, positivity) and how to translate causal parameters into statistical estimands. |\n| [Causal Roadmap Tutorial](roadmap_tutorial.Rmd) | An interactive, end-to-end walkthrough of the Causal Roadmap applied to a pharmacoepidemiology example, with full R code for g-computation, IPTW, and TMLE. |\n\n---\n\n## Part II: Estimation Methods\n\nThese chapters cover the core estimation approaches for causal inference, from outcome modeling to doubly robust methods, with progressive worked examples in R.\n\n| Chapter | Description |\n|---------|-------------|\n| [2.1 G-Computation](02-01-gcomputation.qmd) | Outcome modeling and standardization: fit a model for $E[Y \\mid A, W]$, predict under interventions, and average to get marginal causal effects. |\n| [2.2 Inverse Probability of Treatment Weighting](02-02-iptw.qmd) | Propensity-score-based estimation: reweight the sample to create a pseudo-population where treatment is independent of confounders. Covers stabilized weights, truncation, and diagnostics. |\n| [2.3 Doubly Robust Estimation and TMLE](02-03-doubly-robust-tmle.qmd) | AIPW and TMLE side by side: why combining outcome and treatment models gives you two chances to get it right, with efficient influence curve--based inference. |\n| [2.4 From Question to Estimate --- TMLE in Practice](02-04-tmle-teaching-examples.qmd) | A progressive, illustrated walkthrough comparing naive, g-computation, IPTW, AIPW, and TMLE estimators on a single cardiovascular safety dataset. Includes diagnostic checks and Super Learner integration. |\n| [SuperLearner and Machine Learning](superlearner.Rmd) | How ensemble machine learning (SuperLearner) improves nuisance function estimation for causal inference: cross-validation, loss functions, library specification, and integration with TMLE. |\n\n---\n\n## Part III: Advanced Topics\n\nThese chapters extend the core methods to realistic settings: longitudinal data with time-varying confounding, effect modification, advanced diagnostics, hybrid trial--observational designs, and mediation analysis.\n\n| Chapter | Description |\n|---------|-------------|\n| [3.3 Longitudinal Case Study](03-03-longitudinal-case-study.qmd) | A worked case study applying the Causal Roadmap to a longitudinal pharmacoepidemiology setting with time-varying confounding (denosumab vs. zoledronic acid). |\n| [3.4 Effect Modification](03-04-effect-modification.qmd) | Conditional average treatment effects (CATE), TMLE-based subgroup analyses, and causal forests for heterogeneous treatment effect estimation. |\n| [3.5 Advanced Diagnostics](03-05-advanced-diagnostics.qmd) | E-values, quantitative bias analysis, negative control outcomes and exposures, influence curve diagnostics, and calibration checks for causal analyses. |\n| [3.6 RWD Meets RCT: Hybrid Designs](03-06-rwd-meets-rct-hybrid-designs.qmd) | External control arms, transportability, ES-CV-TMLE, and A-TMLE for combining randomized and real-world data sources. |\n| [3.7 Imperfect Adherence and Longitudinal TMLE](03-07-longitudinal-td-confounding.qmd) | Time-dependent confounding affected by prior treatment, and longitudinal TMLE (L-TMLE) for treatment-policy and per-protocol estimands. |\n| [3.8 TMLE in the Clean-Room Framework](03-08-tmle-clean-room.qmd) | A from-scratch, pedagogical implementation of TMLE with no package dependencies --- every step transparent and annotated. |\n| [3.9 An Illustrated Guide to Longitudinal TMLE](03-09-illustrated-ltmle.qmd) | A visual, step-by-step guide to L-TMLE: backwards sequential regression, cumulative treatment probabilities, and time-step-specific targeting, following the KH Stats style. |\n| [3.10 TMLE for Mediation Analysis](03-10-tmle-mediation.qmd) | Natural direct and indirect effects via TMLE: density ratio clever covariates, Monte Carlo integration, and cross-world assumptions for mediation decomposition. |\n| [3.11 Estimands in Time-to-Event Safety Analyses](03-11-estimands-tte-safety.qmd) | How treatment-policy, while-on-treatment, and hypothetical estimand strategies change what a safety analysis measures, with simulation-based comparisons of KM, IPCW, and TMLE estimators. |\n\n---\n\n## Appendices\n\n| Chapter | Description |\n|---------|-------------|\n| [Common Pitfalls](common-pitfalls.Rmd) | A catalog of the most frequent mistakes in causal inference --- from confusing association with causation to ignoring positivity violations --- and how to avoid them. |\n| [Annotated Bibliography](anotated_bibliography.Rmd) | Key readings in causal inference, targeted learning, and real-world evidence generation, with annotations summarizing each paper's contribution. |\n| [Other Resources](other_resources.Rmd) | Links to external courses, tutorials, and reference sites for further learning. |\n\n---\n\n## Package installations\n\nTo run the code examples in this book, install the following R packages:\n\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n## Core CRAN packages\ncran_pkgs <- c(\n  \"tidyverse\", \"here\", \"sandwich\", \"lmtest\", \"Matrix\", \"survival\"\n)\n\n## Super Learner ecosystem\nsl_pkgs <- c(\n  \"SuperLearner\", \"glmnet\", \"gam\", \"ranger\", \"randomForest\", \"xgboost\"\n)\n\n## Targeted Learning and causal inference\ncausal_pkgs <- c(\n  \"tmle\", \"ltmle\", \"lmtp\", \"hal9001\", \"origami\"\n)\n\n## Diagnostics and sensitivity analysis\ndiagnostic_pkgs <- c(\"EValue\", \"episensr\", \"causalsens\")\n\n## Combine and install missing packages\nall_pkgs <- unique(c(cran_pkgs, sl_pkgs, causal_pkgs, diagnostic_pkgs))\ninstalled <- rownames(installed.packages())\nto_install <- setdiff(all_pkgs, installed)\n\nif (length(to_install) > 0) {\n  install.packages(to_install, dependencies = TRUE)\n}\n```\n:::\n\n\n\n\n",
