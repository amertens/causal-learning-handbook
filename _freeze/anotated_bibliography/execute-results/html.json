Each annotation summarizes why the paper is important and what it contributes to causal reasoning and applied biostatistics.\n\n### to add:\n\nTargeted learning in real-world comparative effectiveness research with time-varying interventions\nhttps://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/sim.6099\n\n---\n\n## 1. Causal Inference Roadmap and Target Trial Emulation\n\n**Dang et al. (2023)** – *A causal roadmap for generating high-quality real-world evidence.*  \nIntroduces the Causal Roadmap framework for structuring causal analyses in observational data. Emphasizes transparency, assumptions, and reproducibility in real-world evidence.\n\n**Gruber et al. (2023)** – *Evaluating and improving real-world evidence with Targeted Learning.*  \nApplies the roadmap to re-analyze published results using TMLE, highlighting the link between causal identification and robust estimation.\n\n**Williamson et al. (2023)** – *An application of the Causal Roadmap in two safety monitoring case studies.*  \nDemonstrates roadmap principles in practice for safety monitoring and outcome prediction using electronic health records.\n\n**Hernán & Robins (2016)** – *Using big data to emulate a target trial when a randomized trial is not available.*  \nDefines *target trial emulation*, a cornerstone idea for translating causal inference principles to observational study design.\n\n---\n\n## 2. Estimand Specification in Clinical Studies\n\n**ICH E9 (R1) Addendum (2019)** – *Addendum on Estimands and Sensitivity Analyses in Clinical Trials.*  \nEstablishes the estimand framework to align clinical trial objectives, analyses, and interpretations.\n\n**Rufibach (2019)** – *Treatment effect quantification for time-to-event endpoints – Estimands, analysis strategies, and beyond.*  \nApplies the estimand framework to survival outcomes, clarifying how censoring and non-proportional hazards affect effect interpretation.\n\n---\n\n## 3. Super Learner Ensemble Learning\n\n**van der Laan, Polley & Hubbard (2007)** – *Super Learner.*  \nA foundational paper introducing ensemble learning via cross-validation for optimal prediction and causal estimation.\n\n**Phillips et al. (2023)** – *Practical considerations for specifying a Super Learner.*  \nA practical tutorial on constructing and validating Super Learners, including library specification, cross-validation, and reproducibility.\n\n---\n\n## 4. Targeted Maximum Likelihood Estimation (TMLE)\n\n**Gruber & van der Laan (2010)** – *Targeted Maximum Likelihood Estimation: A Gentle Introduction.*  \nProvides a clear step-by-step introduction to TMLE, integrating machine learning and influence function theory for efficient, doubly robust estimation.\n\n---\n\n## 5. Time-Dependent Confounding and Intercurrent Events\n\n**Petersen (2014)** – *Applying a Causal Road Map in Settings with Time-dependent Confounding.*  \nDiscusses longitudinal causal inference and how to handle time-dependent confounding through g-methods and TMLE.\n\n**Stensrud et al. (2019)** – *Limitations of hazard ratios in clinical trials.*  \nExplains why hazard ratios can be misleading as causal measures and encourages absolute or survival-based contrasts.\n\n**Martinussen (2022)** – *Causality and the Cox Regression Model.*  \nClarifies the mathematical and conceptual limitations of hazard ratios, advocating more interpretable causal estimands.\n\n---\n\n## 6. Dynamic Treatment Regimes and Stochastic Interventions\n\n**Chakraborty & Murphy (2014)** – *Dynamic Treatment Regimes.*  \nA comprehensive overview of adaptive treatment strategies and their estimation through sequential designs and reinforcement learning methods.\n\n**Kennedy (2019)** – *Nonparametric causal effects based on incremental propensity score interventions.*  \nIntroduces stochastic interventions that shift treatment probabilities incrementally, addressing positivity violations and improving policy relevance.\n\n---\n\n## 7. Longitudinal TMLE and Related Methods\n\n**Lendle et al. (2017)** – *ltmle: An R package implementing targeted ML for longitudinal data.*  \nPresents practical TMLE tools for longitudinal data in R, connecting theory to applied estimation in complex settings with time-varying confounders.\n\n---\n\n### Suggested Reading Order\n\n1. *Dang et al. (2023)* and *Hernán & Robins (2016)* – conceptual grounding  \n2. *van der Laan et al. (2007)* and *Gruber & van der Laan (2010)* – estimation and implementation  \n3. *Lendle et al.
