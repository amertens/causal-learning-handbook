# Defining the Causal Question

We start by expressing our scientific goal in causal terms:

> What is the 3-year risk difference in cardiovascular events if everyone were treated with denosumab versus zoledronic acid?

# Identify the Target Population and Assumptions

We use the **Causal Roadmap** to structure the study design and analysis.

# Simulated example of data setup
set.seed(123)
n <- 1000
W <- data.frame(age = rnorm(n, 70, 8), ckd = rbinom(n, 1, 0.2))
A <- rbinom(n, 1, plogis(-1 + 0.02*W$age + 0.6*W$ckd))
Y <- rbinom(n, 1, plogis(-2 + 0.8*A + 0.04*W$age + 0.3*W$ckd))
```
