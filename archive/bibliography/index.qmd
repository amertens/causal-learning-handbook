# Annotated Bibliography: Modern Causal Inference and Targeted Learning

This bibliography introduces key readings in modern causal inference, targeted learning, and real-world evidence generation. Each annotation summarizes why the paper is important and what it contributes to causal reasoning and applied biostatistics.

## 1. Causal Inference Roadmap and Target Trial Emulation

**Dang et al. (2023)** – *A causal roadmap for generating high-quality real-world evidence.*  
Introduces the Causal Roadmap framework for structuring causal analyses in observational data. Emphasizes transparency, assumptions, and reproducibility in real-world evidence.

**Gruber et al. (2023)** – *Evaluating and improving real-world evidence with Targeted Learning.*  
Applies the roadmap to re-analyze published results using TMLE, highlighting the link between causal identification and robust estimation.

**Williamson et al. (2023)** – *An application of the Causal Roadmap in two safety monitoring case studies.*  
Demonstrates roadmap principles in practice for safety monitoring and outcome prediction using electronic health records.

**Hernán & Robins (2016)** – *Using big data to emulate a target trial when a randomized trial is not available.*  
Defines *target trial emulation*, a cornerstone idea for translating causal inference principles to observational study design.

## 2. Estimand Specification in Clinical Studies

**ICH E9 (R1) Addendum (2019)** – *Addendum on Estimands and Sensitivity Analyses in Clinical Trials.*  
Establishes the estimand framework to align clinical trial objectives, analyses, and interpretations.

**Rufibach (2019)** – *Treatment effect quantification for time-to-event endpoints – Estimands, analysis strategies, and beyond.*  
Applies the estimand framework to survival outcomes, clarifying how censoring and non-proportional hazards affect effect interpretation.

---

## 3. Super Learner Ensemble Learning

**van der Laan, Polley & Hubbard (2007)** – *Super Learner.*  
A foundational paper introducing ensemble learning via cross-validation for optimal prediction and causal estimation.

**Phillips et al. (2023)** – *Practical considerations for specifying a Super Learner.*  
A practical tutorial on constructing and validating Super Learners, including library specification, cross-validation, and reproducibility.

---

## 4. Targeted Maximum Likelihood Estimation (TMLE)

**Gruber & van der Laan (2010)** – *Targeted Maximum Likelihood Estimation: A Gentle Introduction.*  
Provides a clear step-by-step introduction to TMLE, integrating machine learning and influence function theory for efficient, doubly robust estimation.

---

## 5. Time-Dependent Confounding and Intercurrent Events

**Petersen (2014)** – *Applying a Causal Road Map in Settings with Time-dependent Confounding.*  
Discusses longitudinal causal inference and how to handle time-dependent confounding through g-methods and TMLE.

**Stensrud et al. (2019)** – *Limitations of hazard ratios in clinical trials.*  
Explains why hazard ratios can be misleading as causal measures and encourages absolute or survival-based contrasts.

**Martinussen (2022)** – *Causality and the Cox Regression Model.*  
Clarifies the mathematical and conceptual limitations of hazard ratios, advocating more interpretable causal estimands.

---

## 6. Dynamic Treatment Regimes and Stochastic Interventions

**Chakraborty & Murphy (2014)** – *Dynamic Treatment Regimes.*  
A comprehensive overview of adaptive treatment strategies and their estimation through sequential designs and reinforcement learning methods.

**Kennedy (2019)** – *Nonparametric causal effects based on incremental propensity score interventions.*  
Introduces stochastic interventions that shift treatment probabilities incrementally, addressing positivity violations and improving policy relevance.

---

## 7. Longitudinal TMLE and Related Methods

**Lendle et al. (2017)** – *ltmle: An R package implementing targeted ML for longitudinal data.*  
Presents practical TMLE tools for longitudinal data in R, connecting theory to applied estimation in complex settings with time-varying confounders.
