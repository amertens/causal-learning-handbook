The roadmap helps researchers define their scientific question, translate it into a formal causal model, assess whether the causal effect is identifiable from data, and choose appropriate estimators to answer that question.\n\n## Why Use a Causal Roadmap?\n\nTraditional analysis often starts with: \"Let's run a regression and see what we find.\" But modern causal inference begins by asking: **What is the causal question we are trying to answer?** \n\nA causal roadmap ensures:\n- Transparency in how evidence is generated\n- Separation of scientific questions from statistical methods\n- Clear articulation of assumptions and their implications\n- Structured thinking in both trial and non-randomized settings\n\nWe’ll walk step-by-step through each part of the roadmap, with illustrative examples.\n\n---\n\n## Step 1: Define the Causal Question\n\nThis includes:\n- **Population**: Who are we studying?\n- **Intervention**: What exposure or treatment are we manipulating?\n- **Outcome**: What effect are we interested in?\n- **Timeframe**: Over what duration?\n\nExample:\n\n> What is the 3-year risk of cardiovascular events if all postmenopausal women with osteoporosis initiated **denosumab** compared to if all initiated **zoledronic acid**?\n\nThis PICO-style framing is the foundation of causal inference.\n\n---\n\n## Step 2: Specify the Causal Model\n\nWe now draw out how we believe the data were generated. This includes:\n\n- **Variables**: Treatment (A), outcome (Y), and covariates (W)\n- **DAGs**: Directed acyclic graphs to encode assumptions\n- **Potential Outcomes**: $Y(1)$ and $Y(0)$ for each individual\n\nWe are making an implicit **Structural Causal Model (SCM)**:\n\n$$\nW = f_W(U_W),\\\nA = f_A(W, U_A),\\\nY = f_Y(W, A, U_Y)\n$$\n\nWhere $U$ terms represent unmeasured variables. \n\nA simple DAG:\n\n```\nW → A → Y\n \\    ↘\n  →────→\n```\n\nThis DAG implies:\n- W (confounders) affect both A and Y\n- A (treatment) affects Y\n- No unmeasured confounding (U nodes omitted for simplicity)\n\n---\n\n## Step 3: Define the Target Causal Estimand\n\nWe often want the **Average Treatment Effect (ATE)**:\n\n$$\nATE = E[Y(1) - Y(0)]\n$$\n\nOr equivalently, **Risk Difference**:\n\n$$\nE[Y | do(A=1)] - E[Y | do(A=0)]\n$$\n\nWe might also want:\n- Risk ratios\n- Hazard ratios (with caveats)\n- Median survival differences\n- Effects in subgroups (CATEs)\n\n---\n\n## Step 4: Link the Causal Estimand to the Observed Data\n\nThis is the **identification step**. It answers the question: *Can we estimate the causal effect from the data we have?*\n\nRequires three assumptions:\n- **Exchangeability (No unmeasured confounding)**: $Y(a) \\perp A | W$\n- **Positivity**: Everyone has a nonzero probability of receiving each treatment, given W\n- **Consistency**: The observed outcome equals the potential outcome under the received treatment\n\nIf satisfied, we can identify:\n\n$$\nE[Y(1) - Y(0)] = E_W[ E[Y | A = 1, W] - E[Y | A = 0, W] ]\n$$\n\n---\n\n## Step 5: Choose a Statistical Estimator\n\nThis step translates the identified quantity into an algorithm we can apply to data.\n\nOptions include:\n- **G-computation**: Predict outcomes under each treatment, average over W\n- **IPTW**: Weight observations by inverse probability of treatment\n- **TMLE**: Targeted learning that combines outcome and treatment models\n\nWe’ll explore these in later chapters. The choice depends on:\n- Assumptions you’re willing to make\n- Sample size\n- Tolerance for model misspecification\n\n---\n\n## Step 6: Evaluate and Interpret\n\nOnce you've estimated your parameter, interpretation is **not automatic**.\n\n- Are your assumptions plausible?\n- What does your estimate mean for real-world decisions?\n- Can you generalize to other populations?\n\nTools for evaluation:\n- Sensitivity analyses\n- Negative control outcomes\n- Covariate balance checks\n- Expert consultation\n\n---\n\n## A Simple Simulated Example\n\nWe'll simulate a small dataset to show how steps 1-5 look in practice.\n\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nset.seed(42)\nn <- 1000\nage <- rnorm(n, 75, 6)\ncvd_history <- rbinom(n, 1, plogis(0.1 * (age - 70)))\nW <- data.frame(age, cvd_history)\nA <- rbinom(n, 1, plogis(-1 + 0.05 * (age - 70) + 1.5 * cvd_history))\nY <- rbinom(n, 1, plogis(-2 + 0.4 * A + 0.1 * (age - 70) + 1 * cvd_history))\ndata <- data.frame(W, A, Y)\n```\n:::\n\n\n\n\nEstimate ATE using g-computation:\n\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nmodel <- glm(Y ~ A + age + cvd_history, family = binomial, data = data)\nnewdata1 <- transform(data, A = 1)\nnewdata0 <- transform(data, A = 0)\np1 <- predict(model, newdata = newdata1, type = \"response\")\np0 <- predict(model, newdata = newdata0, type = \"response\")\nmean(p1 - p0)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n\n```\n[1] 0.1206902\n```\n\n\n:::\n:::\n\n\n\n\n---\n\n## Summary\n\nThe Causal Roadmap gives a rigorous framework for designing and evaluating real-world effect estimates. Before choosing a statistical method, start with the science:\n- Define your causal question\n- Specify your model and assumptions\n- Decide how to express the effect\n- Choose a transparent, defensible method\n\nIn the next chapter, we’ll explore different estimation strategies in detail.\n",
