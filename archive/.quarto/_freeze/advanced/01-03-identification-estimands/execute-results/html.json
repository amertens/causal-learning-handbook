This is the crucial middle step of the Causal Roadmap: translating what we *want* to know into what we *can* learn from the dataset at hand.\n\nWe will walk carefully through:\n- Identification: when causal effects are estimable from data\n- Statistical estimands: mapping causal parameters to observable quantities\n- Positivity, consistency, and exchangeability in practice\n- Why regression coefficients are *not* causal effects\n- How to compute identified estimands using real R code\n\n---\n\n# 1. What Does It Mean to *Identify* a Causal Effect?\n\nA causal estimand (e.g., ATE = E[Y(1) – Y(0)]) is defined in terms of **potential outcomes**, which we cannot fully observe. Identification means:\n\n> **Can we express the causal estimand entirely in terms of the observed data distribution?**\n\nIf yes → causal effect is **identified**  \nIf no → causal effect is **not identifiable** without additional untestable assumptions or new data\n\nThe three key assumptions required for identification are:\n\n## 1. Consistency\nThe observed outcome equals the counterfactual outcome under the treatment actually received:\n\n$$\nY = Y(A)\n$$\n\nMeaning:\n- If someone took denosumab, their observed outcome equals their potential outcome under denosumab  \n- If they took ZA, their observed outcome equals their potential outcome under ZA  \n\n## 2. Exchangeability (No Unmeasured Confounding)\n\nFormally:\n\n$$\nY(a) \\perp A \\mid W\n$$\n\nInterpretation:\n- After adjusting for confounders \\(W\\), treatment groups are comparable.\n- In a randomized trial, randomization ensures this.\n- In observational data, we must assume it (and diagnose it).\n\nIf there are unmeasured factors that influence both treatment and outcome, identification fails.\n\n## 3. Positivity\n\nEveryone has a *positive probability* of receiving either treatment at each level of covariates:\n\n$$\n0 < P(A=a \\mid W=w) < 1\n$$\n\nViolations are common in real-world data (e.g., frail patients may *never* receive a certain drug).\n\nWe will practice diagnosing this with R shortly.\n\n---\n\n# 2. The Identification Formula\n\nIf assumptions hold, the ATE becomes:\n\n$$\nE[Y(1) - Y(0)]\n=\nE_W\\!\\left[\nE[Y \\mid A=1, W]\n-\nE[Y \\mid A=0, W]\n\nright]\n$$\n\nThis formula tells us:\n\n→ First estimate outcome models separately for A=1 and A=0  \n→ Then average over the empirical distribution of W  \n\nThis motivates **g-computation**, **IPTW**, **AIPW**, and **TMLE**.\n\n---\n\n# 3. The Statistical Estimand\n\nA statistical estimand is the mapping of the causal parameter onto observable data.\n\nExample:\n\nCausal estimand:\n> 3-year difference in MI risk if all patients received denosumab versus if all received ZA\n\nStatistical estimand:\n> Mean difference in **standardized predicted risks** from a model of P(Y | A, W)\n\nRegression coefficients (e.g., log-odds ratios) are *not* this estimand.\n\n---\n\n# 4. Example: Identification in a Simulated Osteoporosis Cohort\n\nWe walk through a reproducible R example to illustrate the identification step.\n\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nset.seed(2025)\n\nn <- 5000\nage <- rnorm(n, 75, 6)\ncvd <- rbinom(n, 1, plogis(0.1 * (age - 70)))\n\n# Treatment assignment with confounding\nA <- rbinom(n, 1, plogis(-1 + 0.07 * (age - 70) + 1.2 * cvd))\n\n# Potential outcomes generated under each treatment\nrisk <- plogis(-2 + 0.5*A + 0.08*(age - 70) + 0.9*cvd)\nY <- rbinom(n, 1, risk)\n\ndat <- data.frame(age, cvd, A, Y)\n```\n:::\n\n\n\n\n---\n\n# 5.

Interpretability: Why the Roadmap Matters\n\nWithout explicit identification:\n\n- Analysts might report non-causal associations\n- Sensitivity analyses are impossible\n- Regulatory decisions become less defensible\n\nWith identification:\n\n- The causal effect has a clear interpretation\n- Assumptions are transparent\n- Methods are chosen consistently with the estimand\n\n---\n\n# 8. Summary\n\nIn this chapter, we connected the causal estimand to observable data using the identification step. You learned:\n\n- Causal effects are defined using potential outcomes  \n- Identification requires exchangeability, consistency, and positivity  \n- When identified, causal effects can be expressed in terms of observable data  \n- Statistical estimands correspond to causal estimands only under correct identification  \n- G-computation is a simple and transparent method for implementing the identification formula  \n\nNext, we turn to **estimation strategies**—how to choose and implement methods like IPTW, TMLE, or outcome regression to actually estimate the identified effect.\n",
