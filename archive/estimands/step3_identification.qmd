# Step 3 – Identification

Identification links the causal estimand to the observed data using formal assumptions.

## Identification Assumptions

1. **Consistency + SUTVA**  
   Observed outcome equals potential outcome under the treatment received. No interference between individuals.

2. **Conditional Exchangeability**  
   All factors affecting both treatment and AKI are captured in W.  
   \[ (Y_a ⟂ A \mid W) \]

3. **Positivity**  
   Every covariate pattern with positive probability has some chance of receiving either treatment.  
   \[ 0 < P(A=a|W=w) < 1 \]

4. **Independent Censoring (for primary estimand)**  
   After adjusting for W and A, censoring is independent of potential outcomes. IPC weighting corrects for informative switching or loss to follow‑up.

## Why These Are Plausible in Claims Data

| Assumption | Plausibility in AKI Study |
|-------------|--------------------------|
| Consistency | Each patient’s AKI depends only on own regimen |
| Exchangeability | Claims data include rich comorbidity info; residual confounding possible |
| Positivity | Both SOF and non‑SOF prescribed across all strata |
| Independent Censoring | Possible violation if kidney function drives switching; handled by IPCW |

## Summary

This step formalizes the bridge between the counterfactual world (what we want) and the observed data (what we have). Once these assumptions are specified, estimation using doubly‑robust methods like TMLE can proceed transparently.
