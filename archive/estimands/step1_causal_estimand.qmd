# Step 1a – Causal Question and Causal Estimand

This step formulates the scientific question as a causal question and defines the estimand of interest for the SOF vs non‑SOF AKI comparative analysis.

## Scientific Question

> Among U.S. adults (≥18 y) with chronic hepatitis C who newly initiate direct‑acting antiviral therapy, what would the 90‑day cumulative risk of first acute kidney injury be if every patient remained on their initial regimen for the full 90 days, comparing sofosbuvir‑containing regimens with non‑sofosbuvir regimens?

This defines a target trial–style causal question specifying the **population**, **intervention**, **comparator**, **endpoint**, and **time horizon**.

## Estimand Framework (ICH E9[R1])

An *estimand* precisely defines what treatment effect we want to estimate, aligning the study objective with analysis. It includes:

| Attribute | Example Specification |
|------------|----------------------|
| Population | Adults ≥18 with chronic HCV eligible for SOF or non‑SOF |
| Treatment | Initiate and continue SOF vs non‑SOF for 90 days |
| Endpoint | First AKI event within 90 days |
| Intercurrent Events | Switch/discontinuation censored or weighted |
| Summary Measure | 90‑day absolute risk difference |

By defining the estimand first, we ensure the estimator and resulting estimate are meaningful for the regulatory and clinical question.

## Primary Estimand: Treatment‑Policy Risk Difference

**Definition:**  
\[ \psi_{RD} = Pr(Y_1 \le 90) - Pr(Y_0 \le 90) \]

This represents the difference in 90‑day AKI risk if everyone were treated with SOF vs non‑SOF, while patients remain on their initial regimen.

### Summary Table

| Attribute | Specification |
|------------|---------------|
| Population | Adults with chronic HCV eligible for both treatments |
| Strategies | Start SOF vs non‑SOF regimen |
| Endpoint | 90‑day AKI cumulative incidence |
| Summary | Absolute risk difference (SOF – non‑SOF) |
| Intercurrent Events | Censoring and IPC weighting for switching/death |
| Rationale | Aligns with ICH E9(R1) treatment‑policy principle |
