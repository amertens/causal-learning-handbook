# Step 1b – Causal Model

The causal model specifies assumptions and relationships among variables needed for valid inference.

## Target‑Trial Emulation

We emulate a two‑arm pragmatic trial:

- **A=1:** Sofosbuvir‑containing regimen  
- **A=0:** Non‑sofosbuvir regimen  
- Follow‑up: 90 days for first AKI or censoring

## Simplified DAG

```
W ─▶ A ─▶ Y
│     │
└────▶ Y
```
- **W:** Baseline confounders (age, CKD, cirrhosis, HIV)
- **A:** Treatment assignment
- **Y:** AKI outcome within 90 days

### Key Assumptions

- **Exchangeability:** No unmeasured confounding given W  
- **Positivity:** All W values have non‑zero probability of receiving each treatment  
- **Consistency:** Each individual’s outcome under observed A equals counterfactual Yᵃ

# Step 2 – Observed Data and Statistical Model

We define the observed‑data structure that connects the DAG to data available from the simulation or database.

## Observed Data Vector

\[ O = (W, A, T, \Delta) \]

| Variable | Description |
|-----------|-------------|
| W | Baseline covariates (demographics, comorbidities) |
| A | Binary treatment: SOF=1, non‑SOF=0 |
| T | Follow‑up time to AKI or censoring |
| Δ | Indicator: 1=AKI, 0=censored |

### Censoring Rules

| Dataset | Purpose | Censoring |
|----------|----------|-----------|
| Primary | Hypothetical no‑switch | AKI, administrative, or switch |
| Sensitivity | Treatment‑policy (ITT) | AKI or admin only |

These data definitions ensure reproducibility and map directly to the causal model.
